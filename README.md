Project title: Clean Energy Calculator SDG: Affordable & Clean Energy

Description: With the usage of energy every day there will be a big demand for energy, with some countries deciding to use fossil fuels or Nuclear energy, it will cause a great deal of damage to the environment. With the Clean energy calculator we will be able to calculate and estimate the best optimate energy source which will give the move optimal and efficient flow of energy without harming the environment. The clean energy calculator will depend on different factors such as the flow of water, wind speed, time of day light exposed too, and Heat generated over time. Other factors will include the water wheel size, temperature, and time(Hours, Minutes, Days, Months)

Additional features:

Energy includes: Water, Air, Solar, Heat

Calculate by: Water wheel size, Wind speed, Time of daylight, Temperature, Heat generated over time

By time: Hours, Minutes, Day, Months, Years
