Project tittle: Clean Energy Calculator SDG: Affordable & Clean energy

Description: With the usage of energy everyday there will be a big demand for energy, with some countries deciding to use fossil fuels or Nuclear energy, it will cause a great deal of damage to the environment. With the Clean energy calculator we will be able to calculate and estimate the best optimate energy source which will give the move optimal and efficient flow of energy without harming the environment. The clean energy calculator will depend on different factors such as the flow of water, wind speed, time of day light exposed too, and Heat generated overtime. Other factors will include the water wheel size, temperature and time(Hours, Minutes, Days, Months)
